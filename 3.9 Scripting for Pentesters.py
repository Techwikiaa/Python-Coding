Now that we have all the basic knowledge required to write
small Python programs, letâ€™s look at some code examples
that can be useful to a Penetration Tester.

The following is the list of program we are going to write:
- Network Sockets
- Port Scanner
- HTTP Verbs Enumerator
- Login Brute Force
- Backdoor
